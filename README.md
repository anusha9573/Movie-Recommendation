# Movie Recommendation System with Streamlit

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using natural language processing techniques and the TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset API. The recommendation system is exposed through a user-friendly web interface created using Streamlit.

## Introduction

This Movie Recommendation System utilizes a dataset from TMDb containing movie information, including titles, overviews, genres, and more. The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies similar to a user-selected movie.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Obtain API key:

   - Register on the [TMDb website](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to get an API key.

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your TMDb API key:

   ```plaintext
   TMDB_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## Execution

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the dataset and train the recommendation model:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook movie.ipynb
   ```

   Execute all the cells in the notebook.

2. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   This will start a local server, and you can access the Movie Recommendation System by visiting `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.
